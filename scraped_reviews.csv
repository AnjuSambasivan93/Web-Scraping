"Understanding Delivery Business","Rated 3 out of 5 stars2 days ago""InvitedDelivery prices are outrageous!Delivery prices are outrageous!! Seem to have sky rocketed recently and for restaurants that are 5-10 mins away. Does not make me chose Uber eats as my first delivery service anymore""To person who wrote review; where is your common sense?  All food and grocery delivery companies will charge a premium for use of your convenience that's how they stay in business.  Sure cost of food or groceries are going to be higher in price than if you  shopped yourself; companies have operational cost which includes hiring drivers to delivery ones goods. My suggestion if you're concerned is about higher prices it would be wise choice to do your own shopping.","Oh it's you again",2024-11-19,5
"La verdad muy buena la aplicacion de‚Ä¶","La verdad muy buena la aplicacion de uber EAST la recomindo todo llega calientito y supieron escojer los restaurant mas sabrosos.    The Uber Eats app is very good, everything arrives hot and they knew how to choose the tastiest restaurants.","Andres Vargas",2024-11-15,5
"Run!!!!!","Just keeping food warm (between 41 and 135 ¬∞F) is not safe. If not consumed, refrigerate all perishable foods as soon as possible, always within two hours after purchase or delivery. When delivery time exceeds 30 minutes, food must be held either cold (below 41Àö) or hot (above 135Àö).MY FOOD WAS DELIVERED OVER AN HOUR AFTER BEING PICKED UP WITH TEMPERATIRE AT 106 AND 99 DEGREES. CLEARLY NOT WITHIN LEGAL STANDARDS.","Disgusted",2024-11-19,1
"Poor Customer Service","Ordered twice with Ubereats. First time paid for priority delivery, food arrived later than the standard time suggested, let alone within the priority time. The additional payment for priority delivery was not refunded. Just ordered again two items missing and the side orders were stone cold. No refund for missing items. Will not order via Ubereats again. Tried to leave feedback for the business, was unable to do so! Very poor customer service. Have deleted the app, Just eat and Deliveroo provide better customer support.","Vicki Walker",2024-11-16,2

"Uber eats and customer service üëéüèº","Uber eats is just becoming soo poor and do not care about the customers and protect the üí©restaurant/takeaways instead. Over and over again the takeaways don‚Äôt send what you order but just any old crap and when you complain Uber üí© don‚Äôt do anything. Which is why Deliveroo customer service is a lot better then these clowns.","a ali",2024-11-17,1

"Disgusting customer service‚Ä¶","Absolutely disgusting customer service from Uber Eats, waited 2 hours for our food to be delivered! When I contacted customer service, was told there is nothing they can do only cancel the order. When I said I wanted a refund, I got told they don't do that as the time is estimated! I will not be order via them again...","samantha worley",2024-11-19,1
"Misleading Promotion and Unacceptable‚Ä¶","Misleading Promotion and Unacceptable Service in Germany (SH) as a group we are extremely frustrated with the recent promotion using the code ""HERBST24JANKE"" (or similar). The terms were obviously printed in a tiny tiny small font, making it nearly impossible to notice that the offer was only available for the first 1,000 users. This lack of clarity is deceptive and misleading.A large group of us tried to place an order, and it took over an hour to sort everything out. We had to download the app, register, and then still faced delays‚Äîonly to find out the code was no longer valid by the time we were ready to order. This was a huge waste of time and completely unacceptable.You‚Äôve lost our business for good. We will not be using UberEats in the future :-)","Yasemin Kertlioglu",2024-11-19,1
"Drivers pick and choose what orders‚Ä¶","Drivers pick and choose what orders they want. Leaving ones they don't want unfulfilled without an option for the purchaser to cancel if they're not happy with the excessive wait. They has multi drops on the way.

"It‚Äôs frustrating there‚Äôs no dedicated‚Ä¶","It‚Äôs frustrating there‚Äôs no dedicated customer care contact! It‚Äôs all AI based.

"If I could give them 0 stars I would","If I could give them 0 stars I would. - bad customer service or should I say non existent, only sends generic responses - drivers Never on time- Cold and damaged food majority of the timeUber never takes any responsibility, do yourself a favour and use anyone else.","Natheem Abrahams",2024-11-17,1
"Ubereats don't take any responsibility‚Ä¶","Ubereats don't take any responsibility when they screw up! I changed my grocery delivery time in the app however a driver dumped the delivery to front door of the wrong unit (correct drop off location is in my notes on app) and he bought it 3 hours too early! I wasn't there! So I had dairy products sitting in the sun until I could get there which was 2 hrs after delivery! I had to theow the dairy items out as they were warm AND EXPENSIVE however repeated requests to have dairy items replaced have continuously been ignored by uber eats! They don't give a toss about customers getting food poisoning!","Tanya ROBERTS",2024-11-16,1
"I would give 0 stars if I could","I would give 0 stars if I could. My order was incomplete and they refuse to give me a refund for the missing item. Their customer service staff only provide boiler plate responses and are not able to provide actual support of why they will not give a refund. There is no way to escalate an issue or talk to anyone who can go off their limited and useless script. They stole my money and refuse to give it back.","Ryan",2024-11-15,1
"Discount Motivated","Discount prompted me to use one of the few Uber options. There are few competitors, but few providers. So having Ubereats was a treat.","Robin",2024-11-16,4
"Thieves plane and simple","Thieves plane and simple. They messed up a food order earlier in the week and when I complained nothing was done. A grocery order for well over 100 dollars later in the week and after sitting and waiting 2 hours, watching the shopping be completed on the app, they cancel the order without explanation and refuse to refund me for something completely out of my control. They will point blank ignore your attempts to get in touch, for the love of god do not give these scammers any more business","Tony Doyle",2024-11-17,1
"Utter rubbish","Utter rubbish. The grocery shop function is not bad however whenever I order food from restaurants the driver turns up, drives part way and then cancels the delivery. Then you wait at least another to receive cold congealed food. The online help support feature is just AI - no assistance at all. Not really good enough. Deliveroo is much better I‚Äôll just use them from now on.","Nobody Caresatall",2024-11-17,1
"Can do better‚Ä¶","There‚Äôs a disconnect between the vendors and the customers. I‚Äôve received fast food that was incomplete and sloppy, and I‚Äôve received ice cream from 7eleven that was frosted and icy from being melted and frozen again.","Joseph",2024-11-13,3

"Just choose Lieferando. So much better service","Hires drivers that has zero German or English knowledge and has the audacity to defend themselves! The courier was on the different end of the street and we called and texted, giving him the exact address, naming restaurants and bus stations. He couldn‚Äôt communicate in any language and just left our food on another person‚Äôs doorstep??? Made a complaint about it but Ubereats just ignores it, because the courier was supposedly waiting for us for 10 minutes???","Itgll Amar",2024-11-13,1
"Pizza Hut food delivered not in heat‚Ä¶","Pizza Hut food delivered not in heat bag and driven 16 minutes open so by time arrived food was cold. Chicken was 13c pizza 18c which does not meet UK food safety rules. Messaged Uber eats and they have replied stating they don‚Äôt care about food safety law or that food arrives cold and not carried correctly. Make sure you record your delivery driver bringing food out of vehicle and take temperature to ensure you have evidence to back up if issue. I have recorded all the evidence so will pursue this to protect someone being made ill by eating highRisk items","gary alderton",2024-11-16,1
"Uber eats is ridiculous they've got to‚Ä¶","Uber eats is ridiculous they've got to be one of the worst companies out there.

"Coupon applied when order placed but then original price charged","I applied a coupon on a grocery order. A day after the delivery, I received the receipt with the total price adjusted for the exact weights of items delivered, and the coupon had disappeared (although the coupon conditions were still met after the adjustments); the whole price was charged.A refund was issued after I contacted customer service. However, I should not have to notice the issue myself (or otherwise get overcharged by $45) and spend 20 minutes with customer service just to pay the price that was agreed on.","Orestis Vravosinos",2024-11-15,2
"The worst site and very difficult to‚Ä¶","The worst site and very difficult to get support once order is placed. I had ordered food and when ordering it estimated a delivery time prior to me leaving the hotel. They subsequently changed the delivery time by 45 mins and hence I had to cancel order but forced to pay when it wasn't my fault. Lousy customer support via AI chat which is frustrating. Never order using Uber eats","Hman",2024-11-15,1
"I'll never use uber eats again","Even if you have uber one, they will charge you ridiculous delivery fees, then jack up the delivery time to an unreasonable wait time but not allow you to cancel, then when it's delivered cold or stuff is missing and you complain, they'll give you pennies for a refund. They're crooks like all these big businesses are, ignoring customer replies and providing the bare minimum service support. I'll never order from them again.","Hannah",2024-11-18,1
"I ordered shopping and the driver‚Ä¶","I ordered shopping and the driver dropped off somebody else's order. I have used the help section for a day now to request a refund and I keep getting told that I have made too many requests for a refund. The only other refund I requested was when I ordered a vegan breakfast and it had an egg on top so I couldn't eat the breakfast....because I am vegan.","Charlotte",2024-11-18,1
"Disgraceful service","Waited an hour for my delivery from mcdonalds and when it arrived all that was delivered was 2 milkshakes and a chicken share box out of a ¬£50 pound order. Don't bother with this delivery service they are a disgrace","Matt Brown",2024-11-19,1
"I ordered from Uber Eats and the order‚Ä¶","I ordered from Uber Eats and the order I received was wrong. I contacted the restaurant who apologised and said I should be refunded. Contacted Uber Eats who refused to refund me bur would not explain why. They then ignored my further messages and I can't even leave a review on their app. Would advise using other apps like Deliveroo.","Neil",2024-11-16,1
"I recently had a very disappointing‚Ä¶","I recently had a very disappointing experience with Uber Eats. I placed my first order for about $53 but quickly realized I needed to make changes, so I canceled it within five seconds and placed a new order for roughly the same amount. Despite the immediate cancellation, Uber refused to refund me for the original order, offering numerous excuses instead. In the end, what should have been a simple meal ended up costing over $100. Very poor service and an extremely frustrating experience.","jason jason",2024-11-17,1
"The app is amazing but the drivers are‚Ä¶","The app is amazing but the drivers are so dishonest. I made two orders on Saturday the 16 November 2024. The driver picked up both orders but only delivered one to me. What is frustrating is that I couldn‚Äôt even load the second order as not received as my code was used to collect the order so that‚Äôs how the driver cheated me. I do not think I will be using the app anymore as I just lost R141 and no one is doing anything about it.","Emily Mgijima",2024-11-16,1
"Got robbed!!!","So I ordered a mcdonalds. The delivery woman comes and demands I give her the pin FIRST before she gives me my order. I complied as I didn't want any grief on my doorstep. She then gives me one bag with a drink only before running off to her car and speeding away. Now Uber Eats won't refund what was clearly robbed from me despite me having ring doorbell footage!!!! Had to contact my solicitor as I'm processing a court order.","B Shaw",2024-11-15,1
"Slow delivery and bad customer service","We waited almost an hour for our food when the restaurant is 15 minutes away. We were originally given a delivery time estimate of 25 minutes but we could see on the app that the driver was going in the opposite direction presumably to deliver food elsewhere or perhaps he was just lost. Food was delivered cold and customer service was extremely unhelpful. They claimed it was a reasonable delivery time and refused to give a refund. I will not be using them again!","PH",2024-11-18,1
"Avoid this company at all costs","Avoid this company at all costs. FRAUDULENT AND LIARS! I WAS TOLD I COULD USE A PROMO CODE AND CONTACT THEM AFTER I RECEIVED THE ORDER!! I DID VERIFY WITH AN AGENT THAT THE Coupon was valid right before using it. They told me it was valid. When I contacted them after I received the order, they said it was not valid. I repeat avoid them all al cost. DOOR DASH IS WAY BETTER!!","Kandy Anthony",2024-11-18,1

"Priority delivery is a scam","Priority delivery is a scam. My orders original delivery time was 8:05, which is the time the restaurant indicates the food is ready plus the time to deliver. But then UE hasn't assigned a driver and adds 10 minutes to the delivery time. Meaning even with priority delivery my food sat for an additional 10 minutes getting cold until UE had a driver to assign. UE needs to coordinate with the restaurant to match food preparation time to driver arrival time. Otherwise there is no such thing as priority delivery - just a scam upcharge. So I got another cold, soggy, uneatable meal.","LaughinLori",2024-11-17,1

"Uber eats absolute disgusting scamming‚Ä¶","Uber eats absolute disgusting scamming company. Today I placed an order on uber East for Costa coffee Durham. This wad accepted and them cancelled by multiple drivers and therefore my food was not going to get delivered. I tried to ring the shop to see if I could go collect the food instead however the shop did not have a contact number. I cancelled the order on my app to then go and collect at the shop due to no other options available. I have been charged the full amount of my order for a cancellation fee !!! I am now out of pocket by ¬£40 as I had to pay for the order again at the shop. I think this is absolutely disgusting. I had no other choice but to cancel the order as this was cancelled by multiple drivers! So uber thinks its okay for their delivery drivers to cancel order however when a customer cancels the order they are charged the full price of the order and they refuse to refund this back when disputed !!! Will not be using uber again and will be taking this further.","Sophie Allan",2024-11-18,1
"I ordered two meals and neither of them arrived","I ordered two meals to an address in Germany. Neither of them arrived and customer service at Uber Eats just stopped responding to me.

However, it remained stuck at this stage for nearly an hour, with the driver being swapped about four times! What was the issue? Why did the drivers never pick up the order?I called the restaurant at 14:28, and they informed me that the order had been ready for over an hour! Why weren‚Äôt the drivers collecting it? Absolutely dreadful experience.The help section is completely useless‚Äîit‚Äôs just a bot with automated responses that never help resolve your problem.Thank you, Uber Eats, for ruining Sunday lunch.","Nat√°lia",2024-11-17,1

"Awful App","This is by far the worst delivery app. Every time I‚Äôve use it I‚Äôve had issues with drivers cancelling multiple times. Before they cancel they‚Äôre driving around in circles far away from the pick up, then they will drive past the pick up and again go in circles. I was waiting for over 2 hours with multiple people doing what‚Äôs mentioned above, when finally the whole order was cancelled.  This is not the first time this has happened to me. When during this I go to the help chat and talk to ‚Äúcustomer support‚Äù they‚Äôre just continually sending automated messages and refusing to give any actual support. Support staff kept ending the conversation when it was just starting, sending automated messages and just cancelling orders. Order ended up taking nearly 3 hours. Awful company, awful customer support.","Jess",2024-11-16,1

They do not car about customer service and they are stealing your money.I cannot believe that you allow a company to accept deliveries that are no longer in business.    This has left a truly sour taste in my mouth with a refusal you are willing to lose a customer?   such a shame .  I ordered in good faith to only find out that the restaurant is no longer there and you wont investigate.this can happen to others i urge you to boycott and uninstall the app.","Phil Woodward",2024-11-17,1

Having given email receipt numbers and collection bag numbers, we were refused a refund for a sizeable order and basically told you have lost your money due to a policy guide line. I asked for more information on the policy guide line which thus manager refused to give. When I asked him to confirm my order he rudely told me we were going round in circles and basically there was nothing that will be done. Absolute disgrace from such a large company.

The chat support team has consistently failed to address my concerns, instead opting to copy and paste generic responses with no real resolutions. I have found the representatives to be rude and unprofessional, which is unacceptable for a company of Uber Eats' caliber. This app used to be my go-to for food deliveries, but I can no longer support a service that treats its customers in such a manner.As a result, I have deleted the Uber Eats app and will be using alternative food delivery services moving forward.

"Absolutely terrible and rude customer service - not even worth 1 star!","Their customer service is the worst possible customser service I have ever come across in a company and they don't even deserve 1 star.I had contacted them via the live chat initially to complaint about my order taking over 1 hour 30 minutes to arrive, and then arriving cold.However my complaint soon took a completely different turn to compaining about 3 separate customer service agents, each which wouldn't help me. I asked all 3 of them to launch a complaint for me, and non of them would, each one cutting me off and ending the chat before I could reply, essentially completely fobbing me off and completely ignoring my request to make a complaint.I suspect there's a bunch of them around the same table just having a laugh and not caring in the slightest about their jobs.I will NEVER be ordering from Uber Eats ever again! And out of principle I will be changing my regular taxi service from Uber to a completely different company.","Ben M",2024-11-17,1

"Ripped off","Placed an order today, November 17th and cancelled it right away in a minute and I was charged $29.80 for inconvenience? Really? The total amount inclusive of delivery fee and tax was $42.13 and I was $29.80! Wow it‚Äôs ridiculous! Rip off!","Jen Roble",2024-11-16,1
"The idiot driver left my pizza at the‚Ä¶","The idiot driver left my pizza at the wrong address. I called Uber customer service back and explained this to them the situation. Only just to get an email back from them saying that there was nothing they could do. So basically just lost money due to the poor service. This are crooks and i will never use this service again. Hope you have a driver that knows what they are doing or else you risk what happened to me happen to you!","John",2024-11-16,1

"Uber Eats deserves zero stars - absolute disgrace","If I could give Uber Eats zero stars, I would. I watched the screen after ordering as 7 drivers accepted the job then cancelled, leaving my food clearly sat getting cold. I contacted someone on the chat function who didn‚Äôt do anything to help, and then ended the chat while there was still no driver assigned. The food finally arrived extremely late and was stone cold, I had to heat it up from scratch in the oven, meaning it was even later when I finally got to eat and the food was really dry and gross after being heated a second time. I sent a complaint in about the quality of the food and was offered ¬£2.79 credit toward my next order, which is pretty insulting on a ¬£27 order. I responded to say that wasn‚Äôt good enough and they have just not replied. Just every single step of the way this has been a complete disgrace, I sincerely advise everyone to use any other delivery service instead of Uber!","Amy",2024-11-09,1

"Not helpful at all","Not helpful at all. I reported a delivery man and they, instead of doing something, kept sending me the same (literally) message that they apologize, blah blah blah for his behaviour, but didn't say clearly whether they are going to do something.","Anna Gonciarz",2024-11-18,1
"Wouldn't use UberEats - go straight to business","The pizza and delivery was great - the invoice from the business was lower than I was charged by Uber eats for the actual pizza (before fees etc)  - when I asked Uber eats to fix that they would not - cheaper to just order directly form business even though I have UberOne right now","Judith Kittson",2024-11-11,2

In the midst of this I was trying to get in touch with there support team to ask what the hold up was about but they kept telling me that they were working on it and my issue would be resolved soon. I still expect a full refund and would not recommend using this app.","Cillian",2024-11-01,1

"Extremely disappointed","Our delivery was already running late when we finally see the driver is at our address. My flat mate when out to get the food and approached the driver who was sat in his car. He said he was not a delivery driver. I then went out to help my friend who was stood outside in the cold and dark waiting for a delivery. We then approached the driver again who was sat in his car smoking. He then confirmed that he had our food but would not deliver it to us. Only after we had given up on retrieving our food did we receive an update on the app to let us know that the delivery had been cancelled. Serious lack of communication from both the driver and Uber Eats themselves about what was happening with our order leaving us an hour and a half later with no food and cold from ten minutes stood outside trying to retrieve our order.","Beth Higlett",2024-11-14,1

"Useless, incompetent delivery drivers!","Had nothing but issues with the incompetent drivers. Food being damaged during delivery due to carelessness, refusal to come to the door of our property, they never follow the basic instructions for delivery, 90% of the time they demand I come outside to collect the food despite me explaining I have 2 children under 2 and can't leave them even for a second alone in the flat to wander round and find a useless delivery person, they are often rude to me when I say I can't come out to them and try and direct them as best I can, and now the final straw was ordering ¬£40+ worth of food for the driver to turn up outside and almost immediately move our order to ""completed"" despite us not receiving it! I've now being trying to find a way to contact Uber about this to get my money back for 2 hours and no one will speak to me to sort this out. I rang the driver immediately and he rejected all my calls. Please don't be conned into using them. They take money for a terrible service. It isn't worth it.","Cari Pinder",2024-11-16,1

"Regarding our recent order from New Taj Mahal","Hi I ordered 3 Mango Lassi for my wife who is pregnant and had cravings for mango lassi (Supposed to be sweet), from the new Taj Mahal restaurant. The order arrived on time. My wife took a cup of lassi to drink and found that it was tasting salty instead of sweet. She couldn't drink further as it was salty and non-consumable and just within 15 minutes of the order received, she contacted the restaurant and explained them the situation. The staff in the restaurant were very unprofessional and they said that they will make It right the next time. (What is the point of making it correct the next time when we wanted to enjoy a cup of mango lassi during that moment) Further my wife told them that she will raise a complaint for which the response she received was ""Cheap"". We thought that the restaurant will honor our request and will provide a replacement, but they denied. We were ready to return the unopened drinks too. Because of the above conversations we had, we have lost trust in the restaurant and we no longer need any services (replacement) from the restaurant. The scenario is very simple - We received a drink that could not be consumed, and we lost our money. we paid 14.310 Euro for this order and amount of 2.41 euro was only refunded. This refund is not justified, and we are still following up with the customer care for an answer.","Sreejith P",2024-11-17,1
"Poor customer support!","In general I had a good experience in the past, but when the app multifunctioned once, they provided no customer support.

"If I was able to give a zero to this‚Ä¶","If I was able to give a zero to this review I would have. I ordered take away from KFC that was to be delivered via Uber eat to my work place. The courier was to be delivered by Silvia and when they arrived my work place I was busy so I asked my colleague with whom we ordered together to take my phone to collect as I had left a message that they can text or call when they arrived. When my colleague met Silvia , to collect the food, she showed Silvia the pin from my phone and he said it was not the right pin. Silvia then agreed to wait for my colleague to com get me and when we arrived Silvia had left and a message left on my phone that my Uber eat has been delivered. The courier was never delivered. If this driver can be so dishonest to lie of haven delivered food which he never delivered then what else can they do we your food. Does Uber eat not do a check on their courier deliverer?I have requested for a refund of my money.Please avoid this Uber eat couriers for you never even know what they can do with your couriers on the wayVery disappointing and disgusting","Ani Feh",2024-11-17,1
